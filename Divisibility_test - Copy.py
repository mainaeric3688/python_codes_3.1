A program to check the divisibility of 5,7,11

'''
a=10
b=14
c=15
if a%5==0:
    print("a is divisible by 5")
else:
    print("a is not divisible by 5")
    
b=14
if b%7==0:
    print("b is divisible by 7")
else:
    print("b is not divisible by 7")
      
c=15
if b%11==0:
    print("c is divisible by 11")
else:
    print("c is not divisible by 11")
